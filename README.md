# chat-bot
 chatbot is an AI-powered assistant that responds to user commands via voice while learning new commands dynamically. If an unknown command is entered, it asks the user whether to learn it and stores the response for future use. Built with Python, it enhances user interaction through adaptive AI and text-to-speech capabilities.
